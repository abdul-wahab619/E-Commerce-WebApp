# MERN E-Commerce Project

Welcome to the MERN E-Commerce Project README! This project aims to build a full-stack e-commerce platform using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack.

## Project Overview

This project is divided into multiple phases, with the first phase focusing on implementing basic functionality like product filtering and building a user interface (UI). Additionally, a dark mode toggle feature has been integrated to enhance the user experience.

## Phase 1: Filtering Products and Basic UI

In the first phase of the project, the following tasks have been completed:

- Implemented product filtering functionality.
- Built a basic user interface (UI) to display filtered products.
- Integrated a dark mode toggle feature to enhance user experience.

### Filtering Products

The filtering functionality allows users to refine their search based on various criteria such as category, price range, brand, etc. This feature helps users easily find the products they are looking for.

### Basic UI

The basic UI provides a clean and intuitive interface for users to browse through available products. It includes features such as product listings, product details, and a navigation menu for easy navigation.

### Dark Mode Toggle

The dark mode toggle feature provides users with the option to switch between light and dark themes according to their preference. This feature enhances user accessibility and reduces eye strain, especially during nighttime browsing.

## Next Steps

The project will continue to evolve through subsequent phases, which may include the following tasks:

- Implementing user authentication and authorization.
- Building a shopping cart and checkout system.
- Integrating payment gateways for secure transactions.
- Enhancing UI/UX design for better user engagement.

Stay tuned for updates as the project progresses!
